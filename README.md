#### Project Description
This project is to practice creating a fully functional CRUD application using REST API. The application is an 
event-tracker program that allows a user to create a note, fill it with information, and set a priority level to it.


#### How to Run This Program
This application does not currently have a UI to interact with, but if you wish to see the application working 
go to this link: http://18.216.38.31:8080/RESTNote/api/notes

#### Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson I learned for this project is that variable names matter. In about half of the code I called the
items 'Notes', and in the other half I call the variables "Note". This led to a lot of issues and a good hour or so 
of going through the code to refactor it into a single name.
